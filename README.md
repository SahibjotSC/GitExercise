## QuickSort Algorithm

The project implements various sorting algorithms. The **QuickSort** algorithm has been added as one of the features.


### QuickSort Overview:
- QuickSort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
- It partitions the array around a pivot element and recursively sorts the subarrays.

### How to Use:
```java
int[] arr = {10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5};
QuickSort.quickSort(arr, 0, arr.length - 1);
